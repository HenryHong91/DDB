## Demo : https://shopping-mall-d8c7a.firebaseapp.com/

### Purpose
* Offering a seamless shopping experience to customers, increasing sales and revenue for businesses, providing a business WIN-WIN Solution for small business.

### Background
* According to market research, most NZ small businesses wish to develop E-commerce services, however budget constraints are a major obstacle. It is an ideal project for small businesses that require QUICK, LIGHT, and Cost-effective solutions. 
In order to accomplish this project, I decided to use React and Firebase. As far as we are concerned, the React SPA feature is suitable for quick and lightweight applications and Firebase's pricing model offers a free tier, pay-as-you-go billing options. 

### What i learned?
* The ability to understand customer needs and the specific circumstances of different businesses.
Communicating with customers and conducting market research are important aspects of providing a quality service.
